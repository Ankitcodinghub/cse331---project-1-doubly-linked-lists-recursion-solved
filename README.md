Assignment Overview

Linked Lists

A Linked List is a sequence data structure that provides association between objects through links.

Singly linked list implementation

A well known current application of this is within the blockchain space. In a more general sense, you could think of a music playlist as a doubly linked list where each song is a node and there is a previous and next option as the links to navigate to each neighboring song in the playlist.

Linked Lists have underlying applications in abstract data structures such as trees and graphs (upcoming projects!). They are relatively simple to implement and provide easy insertions and deletions by managing pointers that does not require shifting elements like an array does. Because a linked list can increase and decrease on runtime, it only allocates memory when needed providing no memory wastage.

Project

You will be creating a cyclic doubly linked list. In this context, cyclic refers to the list forming a circular dependency or in other words forming a circle/cycle.

This will represent the underlying implementation of a c++ List. I implore you to look at the core code that c++ uses for their list and use this to help you in your project. You can find an example of this here: STL_List. Download this page, and open it up in an editor. This is not necessary, but can be helpful and pretty interesting.

This is what our data looks like. Here, we have a root node that provides access to the front and back of the list.

Doubly linked list implementation

Recursion

Recursion is a technique that involves a function calling itself directly or indirectly. You will be implementing recursive functions within your List class when specified.

Fun Fact: Type the word ‚Äúrecursion‚Äù into google. It is spelled correctly, but still says ‚ÄúDid you mean: recursion‚Äù. When you click on it, the page will redirect to the same page. This resembles an infinite loop and exemplifies the meaning of recursion!

Turning It In

Be sure to submit your project as a zipped folder named ‚ÄúProject1‚Äù and include inside:

List.py, a Python3 file

Node.py, a Python3 file

__init__.py, a Python3 file

README.txt, a text file that includes:

Your name

Feedback on the project

How long it took to complete

Assignment Notes

Docstrings have been provided for you in this project only. Refer back to this project in order to reference how functions should be documented (description + parameter(s) + return).

Test cases will not test mismatching types. Example: List(container=[1, ‚Äúa‚Äù]), and they should be able to handle any defined type as they are type-agnostic.

The methods below are given in a suggested logical order of implementation. Hint: perhaps you can utilize some methods presented earlier in the later‚Ä¶

Types:

T: Generic Type c++ List nodes‚Äô values are type-agnostic and also homogenous in type

Node: DoublyLinkedListNode ‚Ä¶ types? What is Python Typing??

Mimics strongly typed languages such as C++ and Java, but does not enforce the types (new in Python 3.5) Example: def foo(var: Generic[T]) -&gt; int:

This indicates we have a template parameter type of T with an int type as the return

Benefits: aids in debugging by indicating mismatching types for parameters and returns. It also provides cleaner code and documentation.

For those of you who use LeetCode‚Äôs Python3 IDE this should look familiar Try this out on your own and reference the starter code for more clarity Resources to learn more about Python Typing:

1. Python Typing Docs

2. Real Python ‚Äì Good descriptive analysis

3. Generics

Inner Functions:

We will be utilizing inner functions within some methods:

def foo(x): def inner_foo():

print(x) # I can access x!

inner_foo()

Fibonacci Example (not very practical, but relatable): def fib(n):

def inner_fib(num): if num &lt;= 1: return num

return inner_fib(num ‚Äì 1) + inner_fib(num ‚Äì 2) return inner_fib(n)

Additional reference: Real Python ‚Äì Inner Functions

class DoublyLinkedListNode(SinglyLinkedListNode):

DO NOT MODIFY this class

Attribute prev: DoublyLinkedListNode ‚Äì links previous node

__init__(self, val, nxt=None, prev=None)

val: T

nxt: DoublyLinkedListNode prev: DoublyLinkedListNode

Assigns value of val, next node of nxt, and the previous node of prev

Calls upon the constructor of its super class, SinglyLinkedListNode to assign val and nxt

Note: Doubly Linked List Node derives from Singly Linked List Node to emphasize differences and overlaps between the two class List:

Represents an adaptation of a the c++ List implementation with the underlying data structure being a cyclic doubly linked list

DO NOT MODIFY the following attribute/functions

Root node having a value of None

Serves as the head and tail as well as the access point for the lists‚Äô nodes

Note: The root is not identified by the value of None. Any node can technically have a value of None. The root is identified by reference using the keyword ‚Äúis‚Äù

example: node is self.node

__init__(self, num=None, val=None, container=None)

num: int val: T

container: Python list containing elements of T type

Creates root node and sets its prev and next member variable to itself

Time Complexity: O(N)

__eq__(self, other)

Compares this List for equality with another List

Return: bool

Time Complexity: O(min(N, M)) ‚Äì&gt; M is size of other assign(self, num=None, val=None, container=None)

container: Python list containing elements of T type Populates self with nodes using the given parameters num represents the number of occurrences of val to assign to list. If val is not given, None is used.

container is used to generate nodes based on its contents Only valid combinations of use: assign(num) assign(num, val) assign(container)

Note: This method is mainly used for testing or in other words to quickly generate nodes for a List. Take a look at the code given in the __init__ as well as the visible testcases to understand more Time Complexity: O(len(container)) || O(num)

Time Complexity: O(num) erase(self, first, last=None) first: Node

last: Node

Erases node or nodes in list from first to, but not including last: [first, last). When last is not given, erase only first node Return: Node ‚Äì node that followed the last node erased

Example: 0 &lt;-&gt; 1 &lt;-&gt; 2 first = Node(1) ‚Äì&gt; 0 &lt;-&gt; 2 return node 2

first = Node(1) , last = Node(2) ‚Äì&gt; 0 &lt;-&gt; 2 return node 2

1 &lt;-&gt; 1 &lt;-&gt; 2 &lt;-&gt; 1 results in 1 &lt;-&gt; 2 &lt;-&gt; 1

5 &lt;-&gt; 3 &lt;-&gt; 2 &lt;-&gt; 2 &lt;-&gt; 3 &lt;-&gt; 3 &lt;-&gt; 3 results in 5 &lt;-&gt; 3 &lt;-&gt; 2 &lt;-&gt; 3 CANNOT call erase

Application

You are a co-creator of a music player app, and there is a bug in your code that corrupted some users‚Äô playlists and left others untouched. As mentioned earlier, a music playlist can be a representation of a doubly linked list.

There are three ways this bug affected your doubly linked lists*:

1. Proper ‚Äì no change

2. Broken ‚Äì unconnected Linked List that is linear

3. Improper ‚Äì creates an incorrect cycle

*Proper, broken and improper are names created just for this context and do not represent terms for linked lists in general

Task: Create a program using Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Finding Algorithm that will correct the given playlists by fixing the linked lists that do not make a cycle (2), or identifying those linked lists that create incorrect circular dependencies (3) to let your co-creator fix those with his program.

Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Finding Algorithm

Simple algorithm that uses two pointers, slow and fast in order to detect a cycle in a linked list. The slow moves at an increment of one node, while the fast moves at an increment of two. The nodes will either reach the end of the list or will run into each other confirming a cyclic linked list.

For our application problem, this is an example of how floyd‚Äôs algorithm could identify an improper linked list.

Wiki Resource on Floyd‚Äôs Algorithm

Video on Floyd‚Äôs Algorithm

fix_playlist(lst)

lst: List

Must call inner function fix_playlist_helper(slow, fast) which MUST BE WRITTEN RECURSIVELY Checks if the given lst is proper(1), broken(2), or improper(3)

It is broken when there is no cycle

It is improper when lst forms a cycle with a node other than the root node If proper or broken, return True. If improper, return False

MUST

fix Lists that are broken in place

use Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Finding Algorithm (above)

CANNOT

call any List methods create any new Nodes or Lists

read prev values on nodes, you can only assign them example that is not allowed: if lst.node.prev is None

Note1 : Fixing an improper list was not included in order to reduce the problem‚Äôs difficulty level. I would suggest looking it up if you are curious on the possible implementations for this.

Return: bool

Time Complexity: O(N)
